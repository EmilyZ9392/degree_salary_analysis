# degree_salary_analysis

## This is an analysis of salaries for different degrees, schools, and regions using Tableau to create visualizations. 

### Hypotheses:
* People who recieved a degree from an Ivy League school generally earn a higher salary than those who recieved their degree from other schools. 
* The East and West coasts will have higher salaries on average than the regions in the middle of the US. 
* Salaries for people with Science/Math and Business degrees will be higher than salaries of other degrees. 
* Do "party" schools lead to lower salaries?
